						skyscrapers, architecture reflects the values and advancements of societies throughout 
						history. It involves careful planning, innovative thinking, and a deep understanding of
						materials and construction techniques. Architects also play a crucial role in urban 
						planning, ensuring that cities grow sustainably and harmoniously. Their work not
